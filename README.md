# tide-predictions-graphql

> A GraphQL service to find the nearest tide prediction station and get predictions for the next few days.

It provides a simpler and more user-friendly API than the original NOAA API, in addition to geocoding capabilities.

Tide data powered by [NOAA CO-OPS API](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/). Water temperature data powered by [USGS Instantaneous Values Web Service](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Service.html). Weather data powered by [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev/docs). Geocoding and reverse geocoding powered by [OpenStreetMap Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim).
